# Cooker

Welcome to Cooker! A simple command line rice cooker simulator.

## Description
Cooker will help you manage a virtual rice cooker. This app answers the question, "What if a rice cooker is managed via the command line?"

This app is implemented in **four different programming languages**:
- [Go](#installation)
- [Scala](#installation)
- [TypeScript](#installation)
- [Dart](#installation)

## Installation
Use a modern IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode...) if possible.

- **Go**
- We recommend using **Go >= 1.16.5**
- To bootstrap the application, execute `go run main.go`

- **Scala**
- We recommend using **Scala >= 2.11.12**
- Build and run the application: `dotnet build`, then `dotnet run`

- **TypeScript**
- We recommend using **Node.js >= 16.20.2**
- Install the required package: `npm install prompt-sync`
- Run the application: `node main.ts`

- **Dart**
- We recommend using **Dart >= 3.2.3**
- Build and run the application: `dart main.dart`

## Standards
Each programming language has its own set of standards, as outlined below for the four languages used in this application:

- **Go**: The Go standard is defined in [Effective Go Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- **Scala**: Scala coding conventions are set in the [Scala Style Guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/)
- **TypeScript**: In this project, we follow the [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/core/style_guide)
- **Dart**: Dart coding standards are defined in [Effective Dart: Style](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style)

## How does the application work?
When the app is bootstrapping, the following menu will appear in the console:
